## Race Results

https://a4-andrew-whitney.glitch.me

My application allows the user to input the results of a race. I had to change how the authentication redirected on the server side and implement a way to check if a user was logged in on the client side. The new technology improved front side development by making my code easier to organize, however it made the backend development more difficult as react-router does not interact with express.
